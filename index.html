            Italy
    </h1> 

    <main>
       Italy has had 3 capitals Rome, Turin and Florence
       Though Rome has been the center of attention for the country city of love and such, Rome was only officially adopted as the capital in 2001!  <br> 
       before that Florence was the capital and pre 1864 Turin was the capital, funnily enough the capitals changed whenever they conquered a new region.

Choose a country that you have an interest in, past or present. 

You will create a website with 4 separate pages: 

A home page that contains:
A <h1> that includes the name of the country
A <p> bio of the country that includes when it was founded, its population, and what language they speak. 
Three <img> of the country (your choice)
 A <ul> that contains 3 <li> that contain 1 <a>. This will be your navigation. 
3 Fact/POI pages that contain:
A <h1> that lists the basic fact/point of interest.
An <img> that represents the fact/point of interest. 
 A <p> that gives some more details about the fact/point of interest.
A copy of the <ul> from the homepage, but with the <a> elements tweaked so that they fit the page they belong to (fact1 should not have a link to fact1)
